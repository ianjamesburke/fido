# High priority



On the Social Connections modal, the keyboard shortcuts aren't showing up. It seems like the footer is too small and may be blocking them. You need this to work like the other modal, like the User Profile modal, for example, that shows the keyboard shortcuts at the bottom. Enough space. 
The messaging of follower from the profile view when you press F still seems a little - conbines with the shortcut's not showing up. 


The flow from profile viewing to opening to DMing those friends seems a little jank and needs to be cleaned up. 
On that note, the new conversation flow from the DM page should probably use the same friends and mutuals modal. Let's just open up the mutuals tab and let's search the same way for all of your Mutuals, so you can DM them. 

The keyboard shortcuts for the DM page are not showing up.  
There's another bug on the conversations page where if you leave a draft open, you can't cursor over that draft in the side panel, so something about the way those drafts are being stored or cached is not working at all






# Low priority

Remove test users from showing up in the installed Crate version. Probably more in handling, similar to Howard. 

Add A Planned features section to the bottom of the readme

CI/CD


# Future Considerations 
(Do not work on it right now.)

Wondering how easy it would be to add a fuzzy find for your friends list for DMing and other things like searching followers and even searching for posts. 
Definitely in the new conversation, fuzzy find there would be good, but I think a fuzzy find in an external database is a nightmare, if not impossible?

Add a convenient flow for requesting features that opens an issue template in GitHub.
