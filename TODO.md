# High priority

[ ] - deployed 'fido' app not conecting to server.



[ ] - Editing and deleting posts? Broken.
The delete confirmation page is missing the confirmation shortcuts. We should make them match the "exit without saving" modal popup that shows up when you try to leave the settings page without saving. I like the size and the keyboard shortcuts colors on that. Delete post modal can match. 
But the edit post feature doesn't seem to work right now. I think we should just cut the edit option for now. 



# Low priority

Add A Planned features section to the bottom of the readme

CI/CD


# Future Considerations 
(Do not work on it right now.)

Wondering how easy it would be to add a fuzzy find for your friends list for DMing and other things like searching followers and even searching for posts. 
Definitely in the new conversation, fuzzy find there would be good, but I think a fuzzy find in an external database is a nightmare, if not impossible?

Add a convenient flow for requesting features that opens an issue template in GitHub.
